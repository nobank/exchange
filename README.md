	You are welcome to our lite-paper. Our target is to create a highly scalable and healthily profitable financial institution, 
and to generate a positive social impact providing last generation, blockchain-based financial services to millions. This idea is completely possible, and its time has come.

## Introduction
### Bancarization in Latin America

![alt text](http://testing.ethernity.live/nobank-paper-images/2.jpeg)

The business opportunity we are aiming at is the low level of banking penetration of the population in developing countries, combined with the high penetration of smartphones.

	We consider three dimensions of bancarization: Depth (total deposits or total bank assets over GDP), Coverage (distribution of financial services between user groups, including 
lower income consumers and geographically separated areas), and Intensity of use (amount of banking transactions carried out by the population).

	For our project, the key dimension is coverage, in other words, how many inhabitants have access to sophisticated banking services and how many do not. The statistics indicate a
bank penetration of less than 50% for almost all developing countries. In Latin America, the penetration of SmartPhones ranges between 36% and 90% depending on the country. This
opens a huge window of opportunity.

# Our Project

	To date there is no popular cryptocurrency, one which is used by ordinary people. Based on our field experience of 5 years (technical and business) in the cryptocurrency market,
we have detected 12 criteria that a cryptocurrency must meet to achieve mass use. First criterion is easiness of use.

Our target is the creation of a cryptocurrency for massive use, initially available for CELAC (Latin America and the Caribbean region) and Africa.

In practice this is achieved through the development of:
- A very simple smartphone application (wallet)
- An automatic exchange facility against the rest of the cryptocurrencies (DEX)
- A network of agents to allow easy exchange for cash

Services for the public:
- Sending instant money to the whole planet
- Buying air time
- Paying bills
- Buying and selling most cryptocurrencies
- Sending and receiving cryptocurrencies to / from anywhere in the world

# Our Solution

- Ease of use is achieved by having money in your phone. The wallet, which operates in local currency and dollars. Our field experience with bitcoin operations allows us to make it easily usable for all audiences.

- Exchange rate stability. To use the system, you must accept the rules of the game: the currencies issued within the network are quoted as equivalent to existing currencies, and there is no speculative game with the quotes.

- Instant conversion to cash will be provided by the exchange-agents network.

- The ease of switching to other cryptocurrencies is available through our distributed exchange.

- User services that we plan to launch in the first stage are: sending money, buying air time, paying bills, buying and selling cryptocurrencies.

- We have started a monetary macroeconomic study to calculate necessary and prudent minting volumes.

- Viralization: we plan for an important campaign.

- Tools for communities: we will offer the possibility of issuing currency to cooperatives and civil associations.

- Financial tools: we will provide tools for the creation of financial entities that will operate over our network.

- Security is guaranteed through the use of distributed systems plus adequate personnel assignment.

- Scalability will be provided both in the digital plane (blockchain) and in the physical plane (exchange-agents networks).

# Positive social impact

### The Gap

	Access to banking services is determined by differences: geographic location, gender, socio-economic situation. Lack of connectivity and banking 
infrastructure in certain areas, an informal local economy, high cost of services and devices, low income, low or nonexistent financial education, social
norms and demographic characteristics put certain segments at risk of further exclusion. These segments include women, rural dwellers, the elderly, 
refugees, and the poorest.


### Bancarization

	We can distinguish three banking services related to bancarization: payment systems, savings and credit. Access to saving tools can be significative for 
economic agents with seasonal or volatile income, since it allows smoothing consumption and reducing the risks and costs associated with the need to 
maintain savings; At the same time, the possibility of using means of payment facilitates exchange, access to the formal economy and reduces the risks 
associated with asset tenure.


	Banking in localities with a lack of services is a pending challenge, especially in some provinces where only 10% of the population has access to banking
services, and taking into account that there are still localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants that do not have formal banking infrastructure. It is
also interesting to note that many users only have posses debit cards issued by retailing chains.


	Besides growing business volume for financial institutions, bancarization contributes to economic development, improving the allocation of resources and
opportunities for individuals through access to banking. There has been interesting cases, like Muhammad Yunus’ Grameen Bank in the 70s.
Fostering the banking of these population segments is important, due to the impact on poverty, income and economic growth.


### Positive social impact

- Objectives
	- Financial inclusion for entire populations
	- Alleviate poverty through the development of microfinance services adapted to the needs of entrepreneurs not served by the traditional financial system
	- Increase the use of credit to micro-enterprises by providing them with greater access to financial services, generating greater development, growth and repayment capacity and making the sectors in which they develop their activities grow and in general make the entire economy grow
	- Extension of the banking public service horus, switching to Internet-style availability, 24x7x365
	- The main purpose is that people feel socially included and, through banking and microfinance, improve their quality of life, entering a path of progress and thus achieve poverty reduction

What happens in a minute on the Internet. This is the scale to which we bet.

Some ICOs for existing or planned DEXs (Distributed Exchanges).

Our DEX is just one part of our project, and it is already working at [nobank page](https://nobank.cash/)

# Tokenization and cryptoeconomic model

### NoCash

	Ours are cash-like tokens, to be used for day-to-day transactions, savings, lending, etcetera. They can be considered
a “stablecoin” as their value is pegged to fiat. Using them by means of our wallet will be similar to using a debit
card. While fundraising, they will be sold to our investors at a discount.

	Subsequent token minting will be approved by a DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) composed of users from our community. 
Minting will be only done for specific development projects, which must be approved by the community.
