##Introduction
###Bancarization in Latin America

![alt text](http://url/to/img.png)

The business opportunity we are aiming at is the low level of banking penetration of the population in developing countries, combined with the high penetration of smartphones.

We consider three dimensions of bancarization: Depth (total deposits or total bank assets over GDP), Coverage (distribution of financial services between user groups, including lower income consumers and geographically separated areas), and Intensity of use (amount of banking transactions carried out by the population).

For our project, the key dimension is coverage, in other words, how many inhabitants have access to sophisticated banking services and how many do not. The statistics indicate a bank penetration of less than 50% for almost all developing countries. In Latin America, the penetration of SmartPhones ranges between 36% and 90% depending on the country. This opens a huge window of opportunity.

#Our Project

To date there is no popular cryptocurrency, one which is used by ordinary people. Based on our field experience of 5 years (technical and business) in the cryptocurrency market, we have detected 12 criteria that a cryptocurrency must meet to achieve mass use. First criterion is easiness of use.

Our target is the creation of a cryptocurrency for massive use, initially available for CELAC (Latin America and the Caribbean region) and Africa.

In practice this is achieved through the development of:
- A very simple smartphone application (wallet)
- An automatic exchange facility against the rest of the cryptocurrencies (DEX)
- A network of agents to allow easy exchange for cash

Services for the public:
- Sending instant money to the whole planet
- Buying air time
- Paying bills
- Buying and selling most cryptocurrencies
- Sending and receiving cryptocurrencies to / from anywhere in the world

#Our Solution

- Ease of use is achieved by having money in your phone. The wallet, which operates in local currency and dollars. Our field experience with bitcoin operations allows us to make it easily usable for all audiences.

- Exchange rate stability. To use the system, you must accept the rules of the game: the currencies issued within the network are quoted as equivalent to existing currencies, and there is no speculative game with the quotes.

- Instant conversion to cash will be provided by the exchange-agents network.

- The ease of switching to other cryptocurrencies is available through our distributed exchange.

- User services that we plan to launch in the first stage are: sending money, buying air time, paying bills, buying and selling cryptocurrencies.

- We have started a monetary macroeconomic study to calculate necessary and prudent minting volumes.

- Viralization: we plan for an important campaign.

- Tools for communities: we will offer the possibility of issuing currency to cooperatives and civil associations.

- Financial tools: we will provide tools for the creation of financial entities that will operate over our network.

- Security is guaranteed through the use of distributed systems plus adequate personnel assignment.

- Scalability will be provided both in the digital plane (blockchain) and in the physical plane (exchange-agents networks).
